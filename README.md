## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using a machine learning model. The Boston Housing dataset contains various features related to housing and their corresponding prices. The steps involved in the project include:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: Load the dataset, explore its structure, and understand the features.
2. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training by handling missing values, scaling, or any necessary transformations.
3. Model Selection and Training: Choose a regression model (such as Linear Regression) and train it on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
5. Saving the Model: Save the trained model using `joblib` so that it can be used for future predictions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib
